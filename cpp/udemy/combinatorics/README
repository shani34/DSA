#combination
nCr=n!/(n-r)!*r!

#permutation
nPr=n!/(n-r)!

#formulas:
for binomial coefficient
nCr=n-1Cr+n-1Cr-1


#problems:
1. Binomail coeficient calculation. Top down approach.
2. Birthday paradox: How many people are do have atleast 50% chance to have same birhtday.
  assume p=probability of people having birthday on different day. p=365/365*(364)/365....so on.
